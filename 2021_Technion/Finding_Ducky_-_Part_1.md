## Solution

Using Google's image search engine, we search for the attached image. Google identifies it as:

> 85 Sky Tower, formerly known as the T & C Tower or Tuntex Sky Tower, is an 85-story skyscraper in Lingya District, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

Therefore, the flag is `cstechnion{Kaohsiung}`.
