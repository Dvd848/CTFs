# What Lies Within
Forensics, 150 points

## Description:
> Theres something in the building. Can you retrieve the flag?

An image was attached.

## Solution:

This challenge is similar to last year's [Reading Between the Eyes](/2018_picoCTF/Reading%20Between%20the%20Eyes.md). 
The flag was hidden using LSB encoding, and could be revealed using `zsteg`.
