## Intro

Messages were delivered across telegraph lines using Morse code, an encoding that 
replaced letters and numbers with combinations of brief signals (dots) and long 
signals (dashes). Initially these signals were meant to be transcribed by the 
telegraph receiver and decoded later, but over time operators got used to understanding 
the clacks of a telegraph sounder and translating it. “American” Morse code, the original 
variant of the encoding developed by Samuel Morse, was eventually replaced in much of 
the world by “International” Morse code, which was generally simpler and shorter. 
Although American Morse code was still often used in the U.S for internal wired 
telegrams, the country switched to International Morse code for radiotelegraphy.

..-. .-. --- --/-.   .   .--/-.-- --- .-. -.-/.. .   ..   -   .. ../..- ... .-/-   . ./.-.. --- -. -.. --- -./..-   -.   ..   -   .   -../-.- .. -. --. -.. --- --/. ..   .   ..-.   ..-   .   ...   -/- ---/.   .-..   -   . ..   .-   .. .   -/..-. .-.. .- --./{-   . ..   ....-   -.   ---   ....-   -   ⸺   ....-   -.   -   ..   .. .}/--- -./. .   . ..   -..   .   . ../--- ..-./...   .   -.   -..   .   . ../--. --- --- --. .-.. ./.. .   -   .-.
```

So if we take this and feed it to an [International Morse Code Translator](https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html), we get:

```
FROM NEW YORK IEITII USA TEE LONDON UNITED KINGDOM EIEFUEST TO ELTEIAIET FLAG TEI4NO4T4NTIIE ON EEEIDEEI OF SENDEEI GOOGLE IETR
```

And if we take it to an [American Morse Code Translator](https://morsecode.world/american/translator.html), we get:

```
# NEW # CITY # TO # UNITED # REQUEST # EXTRACT # TR4N54TL4NTIC # ORDER # SENDER # CTF
```

The `#` seems to denote invalid words. For example, the first word (`..-. .-. --- --`) which should translate to
`FROM` isn't getting decoded correctly. We can see that the first letter (`..-.`) actually uses the international
encoding for `F` and not the American encoding (`.-.`). This means that there is no single encoding that will 
decode the message. Therefore, let's just merge both translations to get:

```
FROM NEW YORK CITY USA TO LONDON UNITED KINGDOM REQUEST TO EXTRACT FLAG{TR4N54TL4NTIC} ON ORDER OF SENDER GOOGLE CTF
```

```

Using the [American Morse Code Translator](https://morsecode.world/american/translator.html), we get:

```
RETRIEVE USE A CODE WE GENERALS TRUE REST VERSION IT HAVE AMERICAN FLAG OF OF APPEARS INTERCEPTED TELEGRAPH SOLDIER ENEMY BE CIPHER TO BACON THE TO PEMBERTON MESSAGE EOYFPIJPIYBGYNSVSDRPTMIYBJXSEC ALLIES
```

The words are all mixed up. We can try to reorder them to something like:

```
SOLDIER, WE HAVE INTERCEPTED THE ENEMY TELEGRAPH.
REST OF MESSAGE APPEARS TO BE A CIPHER.
USE AMERICAN GENERALS PEMBERTON ALLIES CODE TO RETRIEVE TRUE VERSION OF IT.
BACON!
FLAG{EOYFPIJPIYBGYNSVSDRPTMIYBJXSEC}
```

As the hint tells us, General Pemberton was an American general from the Civil War which is famous (among a few other things)
for receiving an [encrypted Vigenère message](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Encrypted_message_to_John_Pemberton,_1863-07-04). 
The key for the message was `MANCHESTERBLUFF`. 

If we try to decode that flag with this key, we get: `SOLDIERWEHAVEINJSQPIPUPUKIMYZX`. The prefix seems fine, but we need a longer key.
Searching for `MANCHESTERBLUFF` in the context of Vigenère ciphers we find the following paragraph in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher):

> Throughout the war, the Confederate leadership primarily relied upon three key phrases: "Manchester Bluff", "Complete Victory" and, as the war came to a close, "Come Retribution".

If we try `MANCHESTERBLUFFCOMPLETEVICTORY` as the key, we get: `SOLDIERWEHAVEINTERCEPTEDTHEENE`. This looks much better. 

The flag that was accepted is actually `FLAG{MANCHESTERBLUFFCOMPLETEVICTORY}`.

## Challenge 2

> Operator, can you decode this radio telegram for us? 
> Your predecessor managed to figure out the last two telegrams 
> we intercepted and recorded, but unfortunately they didn't leave 
> us an explanation of what these messages are encrypted with. 
> We think these messages might all be using the same code and keys, though.         
> HINT: We have evidence that suggests that these messages were all 
> written down in 7 columns when they were being encrypted. Could this be useful somehow?

An MP3 file was attached. It turns out that the two additional messages were also supposed 
to be attached, but they weren't due to a bug in the CTF website. We'll solve the challenge
without them.

The MP3 contained Morse Code. Using [this online service](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html)
it was possible to translate it to text:

```
G X A G G A D X G G F X X X F G D D G X A G F X F A V G F X D V A V A G F G X F X G F D F D F G V G F X G F X A V X V G X V A D X G V G X X X V G A V D X V V X A A D V D F X D D F V G X X D G X G G G F A X F X D D G D G D X G D A A X F V A F F X D F F G F A G X G X G G D F F X V A V X F G F X G X A V D G X D G D X A F F A F V V D D A X X V X V F V X D X D G X G V D X F F F G A V A F F A X X F A X A G D X F X D X V X F X G A D X V V G V X X F X G D G A A F A V X V A A X F F F A D D A A V D D A A X F F D D G D G V D D A G A F A F F D V
```

Inspecting the text, we can see that it's only composed of 6 distinct characters: `ADFGVX`. 
It turns out that there's a [matching cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFGVX_cipher):

> In cryptography, the ADFGVX cipher was a manually applied field cipher used by the Imperial German Army during World War I. It was used to transmit messages secretly using wireless telegraphy. 
> ...
> The cipher is named after the six possible letters used in the ciphertext: A, D, F, G, V and X. The letters were chosen deliberately because they are very different from one another in the Morse code. That reduced the possibility of operator error. 

There are a few crypto tools to crack the ADFGVX cipher, one of them is [CrypTool](https://www.cryptool.org/en/). If you're using it,
be sure to configure the tool to use English instead of the default German (this needs to be configured both for the ADFGVX Analyzer
and for the Substitution Analyzer). Using the hint, we should also set the key length to 7.
The tool seems to hang at around 90%, but if you double click any result from the ADFGVX Analyzer it will get passed to the Substitution 
Analyzer which does a decent job cracking it. It doesn't support digits though, so those need to be guessed from the context.

One of the top results from CrypTool would be:

If we add spaces, we get:

```
FROM GENERAL STAFF OFFICE KY MARCH KQKJ TRENCH CODE YXV IS NOW COMPROMISED DO NOT USE IN FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS NEW TRENCH CODE SHOULD BE FOUND AT FLAG PYNCHAHZLE
```

Obviously `K`, `Y`, `Q`, `J`, `X` and `V` are digits, but as we mentioned earlier the substitution module does not support them.  
We're after the flag which we got as `PYNCHAHZLE`, however we already know that `Y` should be a digit. If we take a look at the `Z`, 
we can see that this is the only occurrence of it in the message, so it might be a digit (or some other character) too.  
That brings us to `P?NCHAH?LE` which really looks like "Punch a Hole". However, we already have substitutions for both the `U` and the `O`.
In many CTFs, the `O` can be replaced with a `0`, leaving us to brute force the remaining character and find that it's actually a `4`.  
So, the flag turned out to be `P4NCHAH0LE` (Panch? Seriously?).

Now, if we would have used the first two messages as well, we could have easily cracked the entire code without guessing.  
That would bring us to the key `ADFGVXIZ4H8R6C1P3E9BUTYO02Q7NM5KJWLS` by just playing around with the substitution grid 
([here](https://www.dcode.fr/adfgvx-cipher), for example) until we got the provided messages right. We already have the column order keyword `DFEBAGC` from CrypTool.

The full message with the correct key is:

```
FROM GENERAL STAFF OFFICE 14 MARCH 1918 TRENCH CODE 456 IS NOW COMPROMISED DO NOT USE IN FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS 
NEW TRENCH CODE SHOULD BE FOUND AT FLAG P4NCHAH0LE
```
