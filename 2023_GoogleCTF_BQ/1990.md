## Intro

You've found a QEMU image with a pre-configured installation of 9front, a fork of the Plan9 operating system. 

## Challenge 0

> Hey we've got a disk image for you with this cool new OS called Plan9 installed on it. The shell script 
> provided will help you run it in QEMU and expose the right ports to your host machine.  Once you've got it
> running, you can log into it using drawterm-9front. Use the default Plan9 host owner name and password   
> 'welcome_to_the_machine'.  Remember, Plan9 is about namespaces, files and UTF-8. Now see if there is     
> something interesting on that disk...
> 
> HINT: Does anything stand out to you in your current namespace ('ns' command)?

We follow the instructions and run the attached QEMU with `./run.sh image.qcow2`, then install and run
`drawterm` with `./drawterm  -a localhost -h localhost -u glenda`. We login with the provided
details and get a shell:

```console
cpu% 
```

The hint said we should run `ns`:

```console
cpu% ns
bind  '#c' /dev 
bind  '#d' /fd 
bind -c '#e' /env 
bind  '#p' /proc 
bind -c '#s' /srv

mount  /srv/rio.glenda.317 /mnt/wsys 1
mount -b /srv/rio.glenda.317 /dev 
cd /usr/glenda
```

The line that stands out is `mount -a /srv/beginnersquest / `, let's take a look:

```console
cpu% cd /srv/beginnersquest
Can't cd /srv/beginnersquest: '/srv/beginnersquest' not a directory
cpu% cd /
cpu% ls

/spim
/srv

/tmp
/usr
cpu% cd beginnersquest
cpu% ls
ctl
```

What's `ctl`?

```console
cpu% cat ctl
echo begin > ctl ;)
```

Ok, let's do that:

```console
cpu% echo begin > ctl
cpu% ls
ctl
flag
```

Look at that, we got our first flag:

```console
cpu% cat flag
FLAG{h3ll0_n4m35p4c3!}
```

## Challenge 1


> Ok, you seem to have found the flag... but have you tried writing the flag back to ctl?

Let's write it back then:

```console
cpu% cat flag > ctl
cpu% ls
ctl
flag
ƒƚάģ
```

We got another file, let's dump it:

```console
cpu% cat ƒƚάģ
int W = 5, H = 7, o , O[] = {31, 1, 1, 15, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 31, 14, 17, 17, 31, 17, 17, 17, 14, 1, 1, 25, 17, 17, 14, 12, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 12, 0, 17, 17, 17, 30, 16, 14, 14, 17, 25, 21, 19, 17, 14, 0, 0, 17, 17, 17, 17, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 31, 4, 4, 14, 4, 4, 4, 24, 15, 16, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15, 15, 16, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 31, 31, 1, 1, 15, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 31, 15, 16, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 14, 1, 1, 25, 17, 17, 14, 1, 1, 15, 17, 17, 17, 17, 31, 16, 16, 8, 8, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 31, 31, 1, 1, 31, 1, 1, 31, 17, 17, 17, 10, 10, 4, 4, 31, 1, 1, 31, 1, 1, 31, 15, 17, 17, 15, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 17, 17, 21, 21, 21, 27, 17, 17, 17, 17, 31, 17, 17, 17, 15, 16, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15, 0, 0, 30, 1, 1, 1, 1, 15, 16, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15, 3, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 3}, x[] = {1986356271, 1835229487, 791752549, 1869771365, 29554};int main(void) { if((o = open((char*)x, OWRITE)) , 0) return -1; for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(O)/sizeof(O[0]); i += H) for (int ii = 0; ii < H; ++ii) for(int iii = 0; iii < W; ++iii) fprint(o, "%C", (O[i+ii]>>iii)&1?0x25a0:0x25a1); return 0; }
```

Note that you can copy/paste from/to the terminal with the mouse's middle button (use `snarf` to copy, and `paste` to paste). 
That's useful when the filename has UTF, like ours does. An alternative is to use something like `ls | xargs cat` to avoid the UTF.

Anyway, we have a weird program to run:

```c
int W = 5, H = 7, o , 
   O[] = {31, 1, 1, 15, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 31, 14, 17, 17, 31, 17, 17, 17, 14, 1, 1, 25, 17, 17, 14, 12, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 12, 0, 17, 17, 17, 30, 16, 14, 14, 17, 25, 21, 19, 17, 14, 0, 0, 17, 17, 17, 17, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 31, 4, 4, 14, 4, 4, 4, 24, 15, 16, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15, 15, 16, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 31, 31, 1, 1, 15, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 31, 15, 16, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 14, 1, 1, 25, 17, 17, 14, 1, 1, 15, 17, 17, 17, 17, 31, 16, 16, 8, 8, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 31, 31, 1, 1, 31, 1, 1, 31, 17, 17, 17, 10, 10, 4, 4, 31, 1, 1, 31, 1, 1, 31, 15, 17, 17, 15, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 17, 17, 21, 21, 21, 27, 17, 17, 17, 17, 31, 17, 17, 17, 15, 16, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15, 0, 0, 30, 1, 1, 1, 1, 15, 16, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15, 3, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 3}, 
   x[] = {1986356271, 1835229487, 791752549, 1869771365, 29554};

int main(void) { 
   if((o = open((char*)x, OWRITE)) , 0) return -1; 
      for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(O)/sizeof(O[0]); i += H) 
         for (int ii = 0; ii < H; ++ii) 
            for(int iii = 0; iii < W; ++iii) 
               fprint(o, "%C", (O[i+ii]>>iii)&1?0x25a0:0x25a1); 
   return 0; 
}
```

It has weird macros (`OWRITE`) and weird functions (`fprint`). It's possible to "fix" the program and run it using a modern C compiler but it turns
out that this program can be compiled on our Plan 9 environment almost as-is, so let's do that.

Searching for instructions on Plan 9 compilation, we find [this documentation](https://9p.io/sys/doc/comp.html).

> Each CPU architecture supported by Plan 9 is identified by a single, arbitrary, alphanumeric character: `k` for SPARC, `q` for 32-bit Power PC, `v` for MIPS, `0` for little-endian MIPS, `5` for ARM v5 and later 32-bit architectures, `6` for AMD64, `8` for Intel 386, and `9` for 64-bit Power PC. The character labels the support tools and files for that architecture. For instance, for the 386 the compiler is `8c`, the assembler is 8a, the link editor/loader is `8l`, the object files are suffixed `.8`, and the default name for an executable file is `8.out`. Before we can use the compiler we therefore need to know which machine we are compiling for. The next section explains how this decision is made; for the moment assume we are building 386 binaries and make the mental substitution for `8` appropriate to the machine you are actually using.  
To convert source to an executable binary is a two-step process. First run the compiler, `8c`, on the source, say `file.c`, to generate an object file `file.8`. Then run the loader, `8l`, to generate an executable `8.out` that may be run (on a 386 machine):
> 
> `8c file.c`  
> `8l file.8`  
> `8.out`

Which architecture are we using? Well, if we check the output from `ns` again, we'll find:

```
bind  /amd64/bin /bin 
bind -a /usr/glenda/bin/amd64 /bin 
```

So, we'll use `6`.

```console
cpu% 6c ƒƚάģ
<eof> cannot open ƒƚάģ.6 - 'ƒƚάģ.6' permission denied
cpu% echo test > 1.txt
/fd/0:30: > can't create: 1.txt: '1.txt' permission denied
```

It looks like we can't write to the current directory.
Luckily our host root is mounted at `/mnt/term` allowing us to write to the disk.

```console
cpu% cp ƒƚάģ /mnt/term/home/owner/hdd/CTFs/google/1990/1/prog.c
cpu% cd /mnt/term/home/owner/hdd/CTFs/google/1990/1/
cpu% 6c prog.c
prog.c:1 name not declared: OWRITE
prog.c:1 function not declared: fprint
```

We're getting closer. A bit more googling shows that we need to add the following header files to our program:

```c
#include <u.h>
#include <libc.h>
```

Now we are able to compile the program:

```console
cpu% 6c prog.c
cpu% 6l prog.6
cpu% 6.out
cpu% 
```

Well, nothing happens when we run it though. Let's figure out where it's supposed to write to. To do that, we'll evaluate `x` by adding the following line, which writes `x` to STDIO:

```c
fprint(1, "%s\n", (char*)x);
```

Output:

```console
cpu% 6c prog.c
cpu% 6l prog.6
cpu% 6.out
/dev/acme/1/errors
```

Do we have `/dev/acme/1/errors`?

```console
cpu% ls /dev/acme
ls: /dev/acme: '/dev/acme' './dev/acme' file does not exist
```

Some more googling shows that `acme` is a text editor that can run commands, and that `/dev/acme/1/errors` is created by the program when running a command through it. So, let's start `acme` and execute the (original) program through it:

![](images/1990_1_img1.png)

We got lots of black and white squares. We could have guessed that, based on the following line:

```c
fprint(o, "%C", (O[i+ii]>>iii)&1?0x25a0:0x25a1); 
```

Unicode Character `0x25a0` is a [black square](https://unicodemap.org/details/0x25A0/index.html) and Unicode Character `0x25a1` is a [white square](https://unicodemap.org/details/0x25A1/index.html).

We can copy the squares to a modern text editor and replace them with zeroes and ones. Nothing meaningful happens when we try to interpret the output as binary, but what about pixels in a picture?

The output is exactly `1120` squares, a number that can produce multiple valid resolutions. We'll just have to check all:

```python
import math
from PIL import Image
import itertools

arr = """1111110000100001111010000100001000010000100001000010000100001000011111011101000110001111111000110001100010111010000100001001110001100010111000110010000100010000010000100000110000001000110001100010111100001011100111010001100111010111001100010111000000000001000110001100011000101110000000000000000000000000000000111110010000100011100010000100001000001111110000010000111110000010000111110111100000100001111100000100001111100000000000000000000000000000001111111111100001000011110100001000010000000000000000000000000000000000111111111000001000011111000001000011111000100011000010000100001000010000100011101000010000100111000110001011101000010000111101000110001100011000111111000010000100010000100010000100000000000000000000000000000000111111111110000100001111110000100001111110001100011000101010010100010000100111111000010000111111000010000111111111010001100011111010001100011000110001100010101000100001000010000100100011000110101101011010111011100011000110001100011111110001100011000111110000010000111110000010000111110000000000001111100001000010000100001111000001000011111000001000011111011000001000010000010001000010011000"""

MIN_DIMENSION_VAL = 3
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (0xff, 0xff, 0xff)

# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44061928/
def multipliers(m):
    yield (m, 1)

    finalVal = int(math.sqrt(m))
    increment = 2 if m % 2 != 0 else 1
    i = 3 if  m % 2 != 0 else 2

    while (i <= finalVal):
        if (m % i == 0):
            yield (m // i, i)

        i += increment

def get_next_color(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if x == "1":
            yield BLACK
        else:
            yield WHITE

for resolution in multipliers(len(arr)):
    if all(x > MIN_DIMENSION_VAL for x in resolution):

            img = Image.new( 'RGB', (width, height), "black")
            pixels = img.load() 
            for i in range(img.size[1]):
                for j in range(img.size[0]):

            img.save("output_{}_{}.png".format(width, height), "PNG")
```

Running this, we get all the following files:

```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/google/1990/1]

output_14_80.png   output_224_5.png  output_35_32.png  output_560_2.png  output_80_14.png
```

Here's `output_5_224.png` (enlarged):

![](images/1990_1_img2.png)

That looks like a flag. A few tweaks to the script to separate the characters:

```python
resolution = (5, 224)
colors = get_next_color(arr)
img = Image.new( 'RGB', (resolution[0], resolution[1] + 100), "white")
pixels = img.load() 
j = 0
offset = 0
while j < resolution[1]:
    i = 0
    while i < resolution[0]:
        pixels[i, j + offset] = next(colors)
        i += 1

    j += 1
    if j % 7 == 0:
        offset += 2
img.save("output.png".format(resolution[0], resolution[1]), "PNG")
```

This gives us:

![](images/1990_1_img3.png)

The flag: `FLAG{y0u_t33_F_31Gh7_EVERYWH3r3}`

## Challenge 2

> At this point you probably already know that something interesting will happen if you write the previous flag to ctl ;)

Let's do that:

```console
cpu% cd /beginnersquest
cpu% ls
ctl
flag
ƒƚάģ
cpu% echo FLAG'{y0u_t33_F_31Gh7_EVERYWH3r3}' > ctl
cpu% ls
ctl
distance
dpad
flag
look
ƒƚάģ
```

We got three new files:

```console
cpu% cat distance && echo
94.132885
cpu% cat dpad && echo
↑, ↓, ←, →

cpu% cat look && echo
▪▪▪ ▪▨▨
    ▪▨▨
▪▪▪ ▪▨▨
▪▪▪☺▪▨▨
▪▪▪ ▪▨▨
▪▪▪ ▪▨▨
▪▪▪ ▪▨▨
```

Is this a maze? Let's try moving by writing an arrow into `dpad`:

```console
cpu% echo ↑ > dpad
cpu% cat look && echo
▪▪▪ ▪▨▨
▪▪▪ ▪▨▨
    ▪▨▨
▪▪▪☺▪▨▨
▪▪▪ ▪▨▨
▪▪▪ ▪▨▨
▪▪▪ ▪▨▨
cpu% cat distance && echo
94.085068
```

We moved up! And the distance changed! Now how do we solve the maze?

Given that Plan 9 only supports a horrible shell called `rc` with a horrible and primitive scripting language, 
at first I tried to use a mostly manual approach by creating four files:

```bash
# -----------------------------------

# Filename: 8

#!/bin/rc

echo ↑ > /beginnersquest/dpad

cat /beginnersquest/distance && echo
cat /beginnersquest/look && echo

# -----------------------------------

# Filename: 6

#!/bin/rc

echo → > /beginnersquest/dpad

cat /beginnersquest/distance && echo
cat /beginnersquest/look && echo

# -----------------------------------

# Filename: 4

#!/bin/rc

echo ← > /beginnersquest/dpad

cat /beginnersquest/distance && echo
cat /beginnersquest/look && echo

# -----------------------------------

# Filename: 5

#!/bin/rc

echo ↓ > /beginnersquest/dpad

cat /beginnersquest/distance && echo
cat /beginnersquest/look && echo

Using the numpad keys, it was possible to execute these script to move around the maze:

```console

However the maze was too big, and it was impossible to solve manually. 
On the other hand, automating a full maze solver with the available scripting language
was unrealistic. 

I ended up implementing a bare-bones "agent" on the guest, communicating with the host
via files written to the shared mount. On the host, I ran a Python script that read the incoming
files, parsed them and wrote a command to an outgoing file to be executed by the agent.

The agent code:

```bash
#!/bin/rc

cat /beginnersquest/distance && echo
cat /beginnersquest/look && echo

cat /beginnersquest/distance >> log.txt
echo >> log.txt
cat /beginnersquest/look >> log.txt
echo >> log.txt

while() {
    if (test -f direction.txt) {

        dir=`{cat direction.txt}
        echo $dir
        switch($dir){
            case up
                echo ↑ > /beginnersquest/dpad
                rm direction.txt
            case down
                echo ↓ > /beginnersquest/dpad
                rm direction.txt
            case left
                echo ← > /beginnersquest/dpad
                rm direction.txt
            case right
                echo → > /beginnersquest/dpad
                rm direction.txt
            case exit
                echo "Exit!"
                exit
        }

        cat /beginnersquest/distance && echo
        cat /beginnersquest/look && echo

        cat /beginnersquest/distance >> log.txt
        echo >> log.txt
        cat /beginnersquest/look >> log.txt
        echo >> log.txt

    }
    if not
    {
        echo "Waiting for command"
        sleep 1
    }

}
```

We start by running the python script on the host, then the shell script on the guest.
For some reason we need to hold `PageDown` on the guest console to make it run. It might
take a while, but eventually we get the flag:
