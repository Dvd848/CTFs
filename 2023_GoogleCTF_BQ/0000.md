## Intro

Julius Caesar used the Caesar cipher to send secret
messages to his generals during his military          
campaigns. The cipher is a simple substitution cipher 
that shifts each letter of the alphabet by a certain  
number of positions. Caesar used a shift of three, so 
each letter in his messages was replaced by the       
letter three positions to its right in the alphabet.  
For example, the letter "A" would be replaced by the  
letter "D," the letter "B" would be replaced by the   
letter "E," and so on.                                
                                                      
Caesar's generals knew the shift value, so they could 
easily decrypt the messages. However, the cipher was  
still effective at protecting Caesar's messages from  
his enemies, who did not know the shift value.        

Caesar's use of the cipher is first described by
Suetonius in his biography of Caesar. Suetonius writes
that Caesar used the cipher to send messages to his   
generals during the Gallic Wars. He also writes that  
Caesar used the cipher to send messages to the Roman  
Senate while he was fighting in the Civil War.        
                                                      
The Caesar cipher is a relatively simple cipher, and  
it can be easily broken by modern cryptanalysis       
techniques. However, it was an effective cipher in    
Caesar's time, and it helped him to keep his military 
communications secret.

Anyway, Caesar was a skilled communicator, and he used a variety of methods to keep his 
messages secret from his enemies. One of these methods was the Caesar cipher, a simple 
technique to obfuscate communications. FLAG{rotate_that_alphabet}

This is a [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) and the key is `caeser`:

The Vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. It is a more sophisticated 
version of the Caesar cipher, which uses a single shift value to encrypt the entire message.

THIS TEXT IS A PANGRAM, WHICH MEANS THAT IT CONTAINS ALL 26 LETTERS OF THE ENGLISH ALPHABET. THIS MAKES IT IDEAL FOR FREQUENCY ANALYSIS, AS THE CRYPTANALYST CAN COMPARE THE FREQUENCY OF LETTERS IN THE CIPHERTEXT TO THE KNOWN FREQUENCY OF LETTERS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE MOST COMMON LETTER IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS E. IF THE MOST COMMON LETTER IN THE CIPHERTEXT IS X, THEN THE CRYPTANALYST CAN ASSUME THAT X IS LIKELY TO BE A SUBSTITUTION FOR E.

OTHER COMMON LETTERS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE INCLUDE T, A, O, I, N, S, AND H. THE CRYPTANALYST CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO MAKE EDUCATED GUESSES ABOUT THE OTHER SUBSTITUTIONS IN THE CIPHERTEXT.

This one was a bit trickier to solve. As a [transposition cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher), the plaintext got
encrypted by splitting it into chunks of length `n`, writing them one over the other in a table, and shuffling the columns.

To decrypt it, we need to perform the opposite procedure. It would be very helpful if we could identify a word standing out. Luckily,
if we carefully inspect the characters of the ciphertext, we can see some capital letters which spell out `FLAG`, in addition to the flag 
format's `{`. So, as a first step (well, a second step after replacing `␣` to a fixed width space), let's split the text into chunks so that
all these characters appear in the same column:

```

nti  ornrtoyrgoors te.ksip  crs  c pohelhgctn ie erntatecg teeeAsuvesuX
```

Now, we should reorder the rows so that they spell out `FLAG{` when read downwards:

```
rs r enigm  aierhe i gluucsclhetersnti a rla t riayrgpetai diu Fawhiho}
aicsa coo wbrn  aranmeibti,haarhra,sipklti ci.ctst a lxtcnaenlkLeoakelX

Toneepetlhtseghectnatanst ripctiharaics foarscee ebrn te doemrr c__ltcs
```

We're almost there, we just need to move the last row to be the first one in order to get
a meaningful word in the first column:

```
Toneepetlhtseghectnatanst ripctiharaics foarscee ebrn te doemrr c__ltcs
rs r enigm  aierhe i gluucsclhetersnti a rla t riayrgpetai diu Fawhiho}

pohry patakrntd cilxsU inehe cwthers rpo narahhtr aienlsrtrr o.{rd___nX
```

At this point we can read the full text in columns to get the plaintext:

```python
for col in range(len(lines[0])):
    for row in range(len(lines)):
        print(lines[row][col], end='')
```

Output:

```
Transposition ciphers are a type of encryption algorithm that works by rearranging the order 
of characters in a plaintext message. Unlike substitution ciphers, which replace characters 
with other characters, transposition ciphers keep all of the original characters intact. 
The ciphertext is created by rearranging the plaintext letters according to a predetermined 
rule or key. FLAG{caesar_would_have_liked_these_columns}XXXX
