# Episode 4: Challenge 3

## Description

> The VRP platform is proudly open-source, and encourages submissions. Let's try to change something and see if we can find some bugs.
> 
> Hint: Look around the site to find out how to contribute. 


## Solution

In [Challenge 2](e04c02.md) we got the source code for the website, allowing us to inspect the `/contributing` page:

```html
<p>Thank you for taking the time to consider improving the Google VRP website!</p>
<p>We welcome all contributions, including bug fixes, improvements, documentation updates and style
  suggestions. Read on to see how to get started.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>First, clone the Git repo for this project:</p>
<pre style=" white-space: pre-line;">
    <code>
    $ git clone git://dont-trust-your-sources.h4ck.ctfcompetition.com:1337/tmp/vrp_repo
    $ git checkout -b my-feature
    </code>
</pre>
<p>After you make your changes, push them up to create a Pull Request:</p>
<pre style=" white-space: pre-line;">
    <code>
    $ git push
    </code>
</pre>
<p>You will get back a link to your proposal where a member of the team will review your changes for
  conformance and make any comments.</p>
```

So, let's go ahead and clone:

```console

```

We have:

`build.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

source configure_flags.sh &>/dev/null
echo "Building version ${VERSION}"
go build -ldflags="${LDFLAGS[*]}"
```

`configure_flags.sh`:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# IMPORTANT: Make sure to bump this before pushing a new binary.
VERSION="v0.1.1"
COMMIT_HASH="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
BUILD_TIMESTAMP=$(date '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')

LDFLAGS=(
  "-X 'main.Version=${VERSION}'"
  "-X 'main.CommitHash=${COMMIT_HASH}'"
  "-X 'main.BuildTime=${BUILD_TIMESTAMP}'"
)

```

And a few more `go` files.

We were told to make a change and submit, let's try to do that:

```console

We get rejected by a pre-receive hook! It runs on the server so we can't really modify it. 
But what's that about "Skipping presubmit (enable via push option)"? Let's try to enable presubmit via push options:

```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/…/h4ck1ng.google/EP004/Challenge_03/vrp_repo]

```

Notice how it looks like we ran `build.sh`. What if we try to modify it:

```

```

Well, it's still complaining about the `go` command on line 5 even though the `HEAD` is pointing to the right commit, we probably can't modify `build.sh` like this.
But take a look at how the version is computed in `configure_flags.sh`:

```bash
VERSION="v0.1.1"
```

We can change that to a bash command:

```bash
VERSION="$(cat /flag)"
```

Let's try again:

```bash
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/…/h4ck1ng.google/EP004/Challenge_03/vrp_repo]

And we got the flag.
