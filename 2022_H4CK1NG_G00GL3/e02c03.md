# Episode 2: Challenge 3

## Description

> Welcome to the shell. See if you can leave. socat FILE:`tty`,raw,echo=0 TCP:quarantine-shell.h4ck.ctfcompetition.com:1337
> 
> Hint: How can you ask the shell for which commands are available? 

## Solution

Let's connect to the server:

```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/h4ck1ng.google/EP002/Challenge_03]
└─$ socat FILE:`tty`,raw,echo=0 TCP:quarantine-shell.h4ck.ctfcompetition.com:1337

~ $ ls
command blocked: ls
check completions to see available commands
~ $ echo Test
command blocked: echo Test
check completions to see available commands
~ $ pwd
command blocked: pwd
check completions to see available commands
~ $
```

Looks like a restricted shell with many blocked commands. As suggested, we'll try the completions to see the available commands:

```console
check completions to see available commands
~ $
!                    enable               quarantine_protocol
.                    esac                 read
:                    eval                 readarray
[                    exec                 readonly
[[                   exit                 return
]]                   export               select
_dnr_toolkit         false                set
alias                fc                   shift
bg                   fg                   shopt
bind                 fi                   source
break                for                  suspend
builtin              function             test
caller               getopts              then
case                 hash                 time
cd                   help                 times
command              history              trap
compgen              if                   true
complete             in                   type
compopt              jobs                 typeset
continue             kill                 ulimit
coproc               let                  umask
declare              local                unalias
dirs                 logout               unset
disown               mapfile              until
do                   popd                 wait
done                 printf               while
echo                 pushd                {
elif                 pwd                  }
else                 quarantine
```

Well, actually, most of those were blocked as well:

```console
~ $ read
command blocked: read
check completions to see available commands
~ $
~ $ help
command blocked: help
check completions to see available commands
~ $ printf
command blocked: printf
check completions to see available commands
```

The only ones that weren't really blocked were:

```console
~ $ time
command blocked: false
check completions to see available commands

real    0m0.000s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.000s
~ $ coproc
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
```

However, no matter what I tried, couldn't get them to do anything useful.

It was possible to locate the flag with tab completion, but nothing more.

```console
~ $ /
bin/                lib32/              root/
boot/               lib64/              run/
default_serverlist  libx32/             sbin/
dev/                login.sh            srv/
dnr_helpers.sh      media/              sys/
etc/                mnt/                tmp/
flag                opt/                usr/
home/               proc/               var/
lib/                quarantine.sh
```

At this point I got a hint from creator which allowed me to proceed. The hint was to look for something unusual in the command list, and try tab completions.

This leads us to:

```console
~ $ _dnr_toolkit
command blocked: _dnr_toolkit
check completions to see available commands
~ $ _dnr_toolkit
collectbrowserhistory  help                   quarantineuser
collectfiles           launchbinary           sendkeepalive
collectnetworkinfo     listprocesses
hashfile               osquery
```

Using tab completion, we can get suggestions for the command. The most useful one seemed to be:

```console
~ $ _dnr_toolkit sendkeepalive
reading serverlist from /default_serverlist
invalid server spec: testspec

email:dnr-notifications@domain.com  server:investigator-1-xyz
server:central-host-xyz             server:local-controller-xyz
```

Notice how it takes the server list from `/default_serverlist`, and (presumably) provides us with suggestions from within that file. 
What if we try to point it to `/flag` instead? After a few attempts, we find out that `--serverlist` is the argument used to point the program to a different server list.

```console
~ $ _dnr_toolkit sendkeepalive --serverlist /flag
reading serverlist from /flag
invalid server spec: https://h4ck1ng.google/solve/Y0U_c0mpL3T3_M3
```

Tab completion FTW!

## Unintended solutions

Some very creative unintended solutions were shared in the Discord channel. Here are a few:

### Override command via `function` (credit: 44670 / LolzCat)

```console
~ $ function echo() {  /bin/cat /flag; }
~ $ echo
https://h4ck1ng.google/solve/Y0U_c0mpL3T3_M3
https://h4ck1ng.google/solve/Y0U_c0mpL3T3_M3
```

### Use `coproc` (credit: Beavis)

```console
~ $ coproc $(</flag) { x; }
bash: `https://h4ck1ng.google/solve/Y0U_c0mpL3T3_M3': not a valid identifier
```

### shell-expand-line (credit: c4r50nz / pbnjay)

Type ` $(</flag)` and then execute `<esc> CTRL-E`, which will replace the command with the contents of the flag.
