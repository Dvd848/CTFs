# "Wee" Challenges

Several challenges were related to a single website running a "paperbots" service. 
All related challenges included the following explanations:

> Good coders should learn one new language every year.
> 
> InfoSec folks are even used to learn one new language for every new problem they face (YMMV).
> 
> If you have not picked up a new challenge in 2018, you're in for a treat.
> 
> We took the new and upcoming `Wee` programming language from paperbots.io. Big shout-out to Mario Zechner (@badlogicgames) at this point.
> 
> Some cool Projects can be created in Wee, like: [this](https://paperbots.io/project.html?id=URJgCh), [this](https://paperbots.io/project.html?id=kpyyrl) and [that](https://paperbots.io/project.html?id=F53thj).
> 
> Since we already know Java, though, we ported the server (Server.java and Paperbots.java) to Python (WIP) and constantly add awesome functionality.
> Get the new open-sourced server at `/pyserver/server.py`.
> 
> Anything unrelated to the new server is left unchanged from commit `dd059961cbc2b551f81afce6a6177fcf61133292` at 
badlogics [paperbot github](https://github.com/badlogic/paperbots (mirrored up to this commit [here](https://github.com/domenukk/paperbots/)).
> 
> We even added new features to this better server, like server-side Wee evaluation!
> 
> To make server-side Wee the language of the future, we already implemented awesome runtime functions. 
> To make sure our VM is 100% safe and secure, there are also assertion functions in server-side Wee that you don't have to be concerned about.
